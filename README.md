# Nanisearch On The Web

In preparation for Ludum Dare 44, Andrew Dougherty mated an old front
end the LGBTLaGrande team had written for LD41 with the nanisearch/
adventure.pl code from Amzi. 

This combination is a cool starting point for hacking adventure games in
Prolog.

The web interface is currently styled to look like an old VT300 terminal.

Thanks Andrew!
